      \li VL_MTR_Os_CONF
      Reason: For certain special files that contain little or no code, it is acceptable to reduce or omit extraneous comments.
      Risk: Reduced code readability
      Prevention: Functional reliability guaranteed by design.

      \li VL_MTR_Os_STCDN
      Reason: Comment to Code Ratio measures the proportion of comments in the source code. 
      Risk: Reduced code readability
      Prevention: Functional reliability guaranteed by design.

      Reason: The OS extensively uses static variables to ensure the reliability of data.
      Risk: Reduced code readability
      Prevention: Functional reliability guaranteed by design.

      \li VL_MTR_Os_STM19
      Reason: In principle, a function is not allowed to have multiple exit points,
      but it can help improve code performance in special circumstances.
      Risk: No risk.
      Prevention: Functional reliability guaranteed by design.
