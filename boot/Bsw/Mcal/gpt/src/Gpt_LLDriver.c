 * V1.0.0:  17-Sep-2015    : Initial Version
 *
 * V1.0.1:  08-Dec-2015    : As per ARDAAGA-76 following changes has been done:
 *                           1. EcuM_CheckWakeup() is called inside Critical
 *                           Section protection.
 *                           2. Changed the register accessing. Used local
 *                           pointers to remove the repeated use of indexing
 *
 * V2.0.0:  27-Sep-2016    : Updated were done as part of several tickets:
 *                           1. ARDAABC-512 Only the output enable
 *                           bits(TOE registers) of the channels which are used
 *                           in the configuration are updated by Gpt_Init
 *                           function
 *                           2. ARDAABC-346 Add initialized for several
 *                           registers(RDE, RDS, RDM, RDC, CMUR) and re-arranged
 *                           several of compiler flags to avoid duplication.
 *                           3.ARDAABC-347 Removed extra check
 *                           (GPT_RESET_LONG_WORD == LulTimeOutCount) for
 *                           reporting DEM in in case of timeout.
 *                           4.ARDAABC-344 When disabling the notification
 *                           interrupt for the ONE_SHOT timer channel, the
 *                           interrupt request flag was not being cleared,
 *                           leading to an extra interrupt trigger.
 *                           Added interrupt request flag clear.
 *                           5.ARDAABC-751 Eliminated runtime conversion
 *                           (bitshift) of the wakeup source in the embedded
 *                           code.
 *                           6. ARDAABC-483 Gpt_Deinit and Gpt_Stop Timer where
 *                           not disabling interrupt for ONE_SHOT timers in case
 *                           a certain configuration was present.Change was done
 *                           that in case of ONE_SHOT timer the interrupt of
 *                           that channel shall be disabled all the time.
 *                           7. ARDAABC-518 Added a low-level interrupt handling
 *                           function and replaced code portion used to handle
 *                           interrupts with this function in several places.
 *                           8. ARDAABC-769 Added Write-Verify and Hardware
 *                           Consistency check for GPT registers.
 *                           Removed old registers readback implementation.
 *                           Replaced all register writes with macros which
 *                           perform the Write Verification or set the
 *                           corresponding RAM mirror of each register if
 *                           available.One new API was added
 *                           Gpt_LLDriverHWCheckConsistency for performing the
 *                           register consistency check.
 *                           9. ARDAABC-772 Wait loop was implemented for TE
 *                           registers update in all places where TT and TS
 *                           registers are written. An DEM error is reported if
 *                           TE register is not updated in the expected time.
 *
 * V2.1.0:  05-Oct-2016    : Fixed issue ARDAABC-876 regarding initialisation of
 *                           timer channels configured in a specific order.
 *                           Replaced some register channel loops with one loop
 *                           and  a switch in methods: Gpt_HW_Init,
 *                           Gpt_HW_DeInit,Gpt_LLDriverHWCheckConsistency.
 *
 * V2.2.0:  28-Oct-2016    : Based on ticket ARDAABC-875 updated the handling of

 *                           GPT_HW_DisableInterrupt by adding support for FE
 *                           level interrupts, used by OSTM1-OSTM4 timers. Added
 *                           GPT_HW_OSTM_FEINT timer type in all places where
 *                           GPT_HW_OSTM timer type was present.
 *
 * V2.3.0:  28-Oct-2016    : Based on ticket ARDAABC-865 changed used macro
 *                           in compile switch from GPT_HW_Deinit to avoid
 *                           compilation error.
 *
 * V2.4.0:  31-Sep-2016    : Remove old code related to Autosar version 3.2.2
 *                           and use GPT_AR_LOWER_VERSION to map Autosar version
 *                           4.0.3 and GPT_AR_HIGHER_VERSION to map Autosar
 *                           version 4.2.2 specific code
 *
 * V2.5.0:  15-Oct-2016    : Add several new functions for handling Predef
 *                           timers as part of ARDAABC-564:
 *                           1. Gpt_HW_GetPredefTimerValue for reading the
 *                           value of a Predef Timer
 *                           2.Gpt_HW_StartPredefTimer for starting the HW
 *                           channel of Predef timers
 *                           3.Gpt_HW_StopPredefTimer for stopping the HW
 *                           channel of Predef timers
 *                           4.Gpt_HW_PredefTimerCallbackNotification
 *                           notification in case of interrupt
 *
 * V2.5.1:  06-Dec-2016    : Added compile switch GPT_PREDEF_TIMER_ENABLED to
 *                           exclude from compilation Predef Timer related code
 *                           when function is disabled.
