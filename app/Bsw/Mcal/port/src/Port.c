** Function Name         : Port_SetPinDefaultMode
**
** Service ID            : 0x07
**
** Description           : This function used to set the mode of a port pin
**                         during runtime. The PORT Driver module allows
**                         changing the mode of the pin to default mode set by
**                         the configuration at the time of Port_Init().
**
** Sync/Async            : Synchronous
**
** Reentrancy            : Reentrant
**
** Input Parameters      : Pin - Port Pin ID number
**
** InOut Parameters      : None
**
** Output Parameters     : None
**
** Return Parameter      : None
**
** Preconditions         : Ports should be initialized by calling Port_init().
**                         Port_SetPinMode() should be invoked during runtime.
**
** Global Variables Used : Port_GblDriverStatus, Port_GpConfigPtr.
**
** Functions Invoked     : Det_ReportError,
